# Single Page Streamlit Application - Earnings Call Transcript Summarizer

## Overview

The **Earnings Call Transcript Summarizer** is a one-page Streamlit application designed to take earnings call transcripts as input and generate concise summaries highlighting key points. This tool will allow users to upload a transcript file or provide a URL to a transcript. It employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and visualize critical information, supporting investment analysis and decision-making.

## Features

### Transcript Upload/Input
- **File Upload**: Users can upload a text file containing the earnings call transcript.
- **URL Input**: Users can input a URL from which the application will extract the transcript text.
- **Direct Text Input**: Users can paste the transcript content directly into a text area within the application.

### Text Summarization
- Utilize a **Transformer-based summarization model** (such as BART or T5) to process uploaded transcripts and generate a concise summary.
- The summarization will focus on highlighting the crucial aspects of the earnings call, such as financial performance, future outlook, and strategic initiatives.

### Topic Extraction
- Implement **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling to extract and identify the main topics discussed in the transcript.
- Present the extracted topics as a list accompanied by weight indicators that reflect their prominence in the transcript.

### Visualization
- Display the generated text summary prominently in the interface.
- Implement a **bar chart** to visualize the most frequent topics and their weights, providing clear and dynamic visual feedback to the user.
- Include **interactive annotations and tooltips** on the visualizations to allow users to explore data points and extracted topics in more detail.

### User Interaction
- Provide **interactive widgets** such as sliders and buttons for users to adjust model parameters (like the length of the summary or the number of topics to extract).
- Real-time updates to visualizations and summaries as users interact with the inputs and settings.
- Include built-in **inline help** and tooltips to guide users through each feature of the application.

## Technical Details

- **Library & Frameworks**: 
  - Streamlit for web application development.
  - Transformer models from Hugging Face's Transformers library for text summarization.
  - Gensim for LDA topic modeling.
  - Matplotlib or Plotly for generating interactive visualizations.

- **Data Handling**: 
  - Support for text data input through file upload, URLs, and direct input.
  - Preprocessing steps such as tokenization and stopword removal to prepare text for analysis.

- **Synthetic Dataset**:
  - The application will focus on processing synthetic datasets designed to mimic the structure of real-world earnings call transcripts, ensuring the demonstration of data handling and analysis techniques can be performed in a controlled setting.

## Explanation of Concept

The application demonstrates the **summarization capabilities of NLP** as discussed in module 4, specifically on page 12 of the reference document, "AI and Big Data in Investments." This is achieved by distilling verbose earnings call transcripts into easily digestible summaries. By leveraging topic modeling, the tool aids in **extracting insights** and understanding the primary focus of the call, showcasing practical NLP applications in investment analysis.
